<!-- [My relationshpip with Miami] -->
I moved to Miami when I was three and have lived there ever since. Although my family and I immigrated, a lot of our culture followed us - specifically through other Argentinian families that had relocated to Miami around the same time as us. Culture became very prevalent in our lives, especially since my parents wanted my siblings and I to sustain as much of it as possible. My Middle School and High School experiences immersed me in a variety of cultures, food, and experiences. The blues of the ocean, the warm rays of the sun, and the juxtaposition of the geometric and the organic symbolize home for me. They equate to comfort and to hope, but they do not equate to my future.
