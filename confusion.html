Confuse: to disturb in mind or purpose.

I feel baffled, disoriented, and puzzled. My biggest strenght is strategizing. As a result, I am always seeking control. Control allows me to determine not only outcomes of situations, but what happens along the way. Control allowed me to apply to internships, and when presented various offers, select which I would participate in. Control also works in tandem with my anxiety, and always has me attempting to anticipate anything and everything. My desire to control the future overwhelms me. I want to ensure that where I choose to live in the future is the best place for me, but being unaware of the answer, all I can conclude is that being on the other coast - so far from my family - can not be the best option. Yet, I find myself longing to work there given the preeminent job opportunities. I feel baffled, disoriented, and puzzled.
