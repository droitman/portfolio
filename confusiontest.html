    <p>I feel baffled, disoriented, and puzzled. I moved to Miami when I was three and have lived there ever since. Although my family and I immigrated, a lot of our culture followed us - specifically through other Argentinian families that had relocated to Miami around the same time as us. Culture became very prevalent in our lives, especially since my parents wanted my siblings and I to sustain as much of it as possible. My Middle School and High School experiences immersed me in a variety of cultures, food, and experiences. The blues of the ocean, the warm rays of the sun, and the juxtaposition of the geometric and the organic symbolize home for me. They equate to comfort and to hope, but they do not equate to my future. <br><br> My relationship with San Francisco is not as long or established as my relationship with Miami, yet I can not shake the feeling that I will be spending a significant part of my life here. I spent three months living in San Francisco while I interned over the summer, and my feelings about the location are very mixed. Although it is a very vibrant, and historically rich city, it is also very empty. The West Coast is very far from my family, who is all located on the East Coast. Although no place is definite, I am afraid of the possibility of establishing roots here early on, and never leaving. The West Coast presents me with exciting job opportunities, but the East Coast is home. <br><br> My biggest strength is strategizing. As a result, I am always seeking control. Control allows me to determine not only outcomes of situations, but what happens along the way. Control allowed me to apply to internships, and when presented various offers, select which I would participate in. Control also works in tandem with my anxiety, and always has me attempting to anticipate anything and everything. My desire to control the future overwhelms me. I want to ensure that where I choose to live in the future is the best place for me, but being unaware of the answer, all I can conclude is that being on the other coast - so far from my family - can not be the best option. Yet, I find myself longing to work there given the preeminent job opportunities. I feel baffled, disoriented, and puzzled.</p>
